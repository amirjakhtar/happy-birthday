aaaaah, where do i even begin... first of all, happy birthday best friend. i don't know if words can even describe what our friendship has meant to me for the past year. you have always been there for me 
and i cannot put it to words what it means to have a friend whom you can trust blindly, but what is special about you is how you trust me back the same way. 
it really feels special when you speak to me about your problems and in the same way, comfort me back whenever i need you. and yes thank you for making me a little less socially awkward.
you know i dont believe in god that much, but if there exists one, i cannot thank him enough for giving me a friend in the form of you. please always stay like this...
i have thought about your gifat for a long me, and i decided to compile together a list of out-of-context pics representing the entire last year. hope you like it...
